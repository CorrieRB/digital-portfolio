```{tab-item} Things I learned
- The syntax specific to the jupyter book is pretty consistent and easy to remember, you just have to learn what options there are.
- Watching the module videos were confusing, until you can actually create your own structured book, and then you can see how each component fits together.
```
```{tab-item} Things I found difficult
- I found that if I edited the jupyter notebooks using jupyter lab, the kernel name would be changed and I could not change it back using the metadata in jupyterlab or in my text editor, so I had to push to github, edit the kernel name and then pull back to my local if I wanted to make edits in jupyter lab. In a sense it was easier to do the editing in the text editor, instead of jupyter lab for this reason.
- I find troubleshooting things like this difficult. If there are programs missing that is one thing, but when metatdata is changed mid project, or the build fails for obscure reasons, I find that hard to troubleshoot on my own.
